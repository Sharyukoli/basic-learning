 some Data Engineering interview questions that are highly relevant in the current job market.

Feel free to test your skills or use these for preparation. Let’s dive in!

1. SQL or Python/PySpark Scenario

For each floor of each hotel in each city, calculate the incremental number of rooms occupied for each date.

Details:

Dataset column: Occupied_Flag (indicates if a room is occupied).

Example:

On 21st November, 5 rooms are occupied, and 5 are free on Floor 1.

On 22nd November, 7 rooms are occupied, and 3 are free.

Total rooms: 10.


Output table requirements:

1. Number of occupied rooms for each date.


2. Incremental change in the number of occupied rooms compared to the previous date.


3. Unoccupied rooms out of the total rooms for each date.


4. Summary indicating occupied and unoccupied rooms (e.g., “5 - 5 rooms are not occupied out of 10”).


The solution should be implemented using Python or Pyspark or SQL.
