		1.Data Organization:
		Databases structure data in a way that makes it easy to manage, retrieve, and update. 
		This organization can take various forms, such as tables, documents, or key-value pairs.
			
		2.Data Management:
		Databases use a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) 
		  to handle data operations like 
		  creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD). 

		3.Data Integrity:
		Databases enforce rules to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data. 
		This includes constraints like 
			primary keys, foreign keys, and validation rules.


		4.Data Relationship:
			 Databases can define relationships between different data entities, 
			  allowing for complex queries and analytics. 
		
		5.Scalability:
			Databases are designed to handle large volumes of data and 
                                  can scale as needed,
                                  whether by increasing hardware resources or optimizing queries.

		6.Accessibility:
			 Databases can be accessed by multiple users and applications simultaneously, 
			 supporting collaboration and data sharing.

		7.Security:
			Databases implement security measures to protect sensitive data, such as 
			user authentication, encryption, and access controls.



Data Storage: (Data Persistence)

			Data is always preserved in Memory:
	
					
			1.Primary Memory:RAM (Random Access Memory)
			2.Secondary Memory: Hard disk Drive  (SD, SSD)
			File Management system:
				(NTFS)
				  Data is stored in form of  files and folders

	DBMS:
		A DBMS is a software system that enables 
			the creation, management, and manipulation of databases. 	
		DBMS can store data in various formats, including 
			hierarchical, 
			network, or 
			flat file structures. 
		Normalization (organizing data to reduce redundancy) 
			is not a requirement in all DBMS systems.

		Examples of DBMS include file systems, 
					XML databases, 
					and object-oriented databases.

	RDBMS:  (Relational Database management System)
		An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that organizes data into 
			tables (or relations) that can be linked by common data attributes.
		 It uses a structured query language (SQL) for data manipulation.

		Data is stored in tables, 
		where each row represents a record and each column represents a field. 
		RDBMS emphasizes normalization to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity.

		ACID Properties:
			ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity using ACID properties
			A: Automicity
			C: Consistency
			I: Isolation
			D: Durability

		Popular RDBMS examples include MySQL, 
					PostgreSQL,
					Oracle Database, and 
					Microsoft SQL Server.
