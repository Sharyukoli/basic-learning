Trigger:
	fire
	Database:
		 a trigger is a special type of stored procedure
		 that is automatically executed or fired 
		 in response to certain events or actions 
		  occurring in the database.
		What are those events ?
		from which context ?----------------entity-----table
			CRUD (data manipulation)Operations:
			  INSERT----insert event
						before insert----trigger--SP
						after insert-----trigger--SP
 
			  UPDATE----update event
						before update ------trigger--SP
						after update -----trigger--SP
 
			  DELETE 		
						before update ------trigger--SP
						after update -----trigger--SP
 
	
	 Triggers  are used  to enforce business rules, 
					maintaining data integrity,
					automating tasks within database
 
	 Triggers are used  to perform validation checks,
				       audit checks
				       propogating another execution cycles in respective related tables
 
 
	Key Points about Triggers:
			Event-Based Execution:
			Timing: BEfore or After  (DATA Manipulation) ( Update, Insert, Delete)
			Scope: table level scope:
			Atomicity:
