What is the real meaning of 
AI,Data Science, Data Engineering, Database Administration ?

0.AI (Artificial Intelligence)
     Focus: Developing systems that can perform tasks typically require
		humain intelligence  such as,
		understanding natural language,
		recognizing patterns,
		make deceisions

     activities:
		Creating algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data.
		Implementing machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques.
		Developing intelligent applications (like chatbots or recommendation systems).
		
     skills:
		Machine learning Frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch), statistical analysis,
		Programming knowledge of Python, R
		Domain expertise


1.Data Science:
	Focus:
		 extract intelligence, knowledge  from data using 
		 statistical methods, alogoritms and 
		 compuratized mechanism (Machine learning) for extracting information
	activities:
		Analyzing data to identify trends and patterns.
		Building predictive models and algorithms.
		Communicating findings through visualizations and reports.
		
	Skills:
		statistics, Programming Python or R,
		machine learning,data Visualization tool ( Tableau, matplotlib)
		Domain knowledge  ??????		



2.Data Engineering:
	Focus:Designing, building and maintaining the infrastructure and their architecture
		for data collection, storage  and processing
	Key activities:
		Creating data pipelines to ensure data flows from various sources to storage systems.
		Optimizing databases for performance and scalability.
		Ensuring data quality and integrity.
	Skills:
		programming languages ( python, java, scala)
		ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) (Datawarehousing)
		SQL, NoSQL
		big data technologies (Hadoop or Spark, Hive, etc.)


3.Database Administration:
	Focus:
		Managing  and maintaining databases
			 to ensure they are operational, secure as well as performing well

	Key activities:
		Installing, configuring, and upgrading database management systems.
		Monitoring database performance and implementing optimizations.
		Managing backups, security, and user access.
	
	Skills:SQL,
	       Database management systems (oracle, mysql, microsoft SQL server)
	       Performance tunning, security protocols
